INNOVATION 2.0 GRANT PROGRAM
----------------------------

The Innovation 2.0 grant program is our flagship program that will enable a qualified team of scientists and researchers to launch successful ventures, with funding, training, and intense mentoring provided across three gated grant phases. The grant can provide up to $800K in funding over the three gated phases:



|  |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Venture Exploration Workshop (Phase I)    | 16 weeks of intense training and mentoring    | 
| Venture Design Funding (Phase II) | $300K, 12-18 months |
| Venture Design Funding (Phase III) | $500K, 12-18 months |
| 

The SMART Innovation Centre (SMART IC) will conduct a grant call annually and can enroll up to 10 projects in the Venture Exploration Workshop. It can then issue up to 5 Venture Design Grants per year ($300K each) and up to 3 Venture Execution Grants per year ($500K each).

Innovation Grant 2.0 is a gated 3 phase program to prepare a team of scientist-entrepreneurs to launch a successful venture, with funding and training, and intense mentoring provided across all three phases. **SMART Innovation Grant 2.0** conducts a series of workshops for scientists and researchers in Singapore passionate about growing new ventures around their disruptive technology to support each phase of the grant. As in all training programs, you need to progressively advance in skills and demonstrate your value proposition from both the technical, market and implementation perspectives. **SMART Innovation Grant 2.0** will guide you through this process from lab idea to fundable, executable new venture. You will be mentored one-on-one and provided training, oversight, and critical review by the SMART Directors and Advisory Board. The following chart is a summary:
