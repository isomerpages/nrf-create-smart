About SMART
-----------

The Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) is a major research enterprise established by the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](http://web.mit.edu/) in partnership with the [National Research Foundation of Singapore (NRF)](http://www.nrf.gov.sg/) in 2007. SMART is the first entity in the [Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE)](http://www.create.edu.sg/) developed by NRF.

SMART is MIT's first, and to-date only, research centre outside the United States. It is also MIT's largest international research programme. MIT faculty members have laboratories at SMART, mentor postdoctoral associates and graduate students, and collaborate with researchers from universities, research institutes and industries in Singapore and Asia.

SMART Mission, Vision & Values
-----------

**SMART** Mission

*   Support the MIT mission to advance knowledge and education in ways that best serve the world in the 21st century and assist CREATE to achieve its mission
*   Be a world-class research centre maintaining the same standards of excellence as at MIT.
*   Identify and carry out research on critical problems of societal significance of interest to Singapore.
*   Develop robust collaborations with researchers from local Universities and Institutions. Co-advise local doctoral students and post-doctoral researchers.
*   Be a magnet for attracting and anchoring global research talent to Singapore

**SMART** Vision

*   Serve as a major anchor point for MIT in Asia; a place for innovation and industrial engagement for MIT in Asia
*   Serve as a magnet to attract excellent people and ideas to MIT and Singapore in a seamless manner
*   Become a globally branded research center with an Singaporean focus - With diversity in sponsorship oriented around a stable core

Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs)
-----------

Headed by senior MIT faculty members, research projects are organised into Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs). SMART expects to engage over 800 MIT and Singaporean researchers, comprising faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, to work and collaborate in the IRGs:

*   Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) IRG is a unique translational research and entrepreneurship program that aims to solve the growing threat of resistance to antimicrobial drugs.
*   Critical Analytics for Manufacturing Personalized-Medicine (CAMP) is an Interdisciplinary Research Group in Singapore and at MIT focusing on better ways to produce living cells as medicine delivered to humans. CAMP launched in June 2019, with the goal to address two key bottlenecks facing production of a range of potential cell therapies: critical quality attributes (CQA) and process analytic technologies (PAT) for cell therapy production.
*   Disruptive & Sustainable Technologies for Agricultural Precision (DiSTAP) IRG aims to revolutionise how food is produced to meet the demands of a growing population in an increasingly resource-constrained world.
*   Future Urban Mobility (FM) IRG aims to develop, in and beyond Singapore, a new paradigm for the planning, design, and operation of future urban passenger and freight transportation systems that enhance sustainability and societal well-being.
*   Low Energy Electronic Systems (LEES) IRG aims to identify new integrated circuit technologies that become the new added value for reduced energy per function, lower power consumption and higher performance in our electronics infrastructure.

SMART Innovation Centre
-----------

Similar to the highly successful Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation at MIT, the SMART Innovation Centre aims to bring the market definition closer to technology development, by having each selected project worked on by a team that, in addition to the researchers, includes either an entrepreneur or a venture capitalist right from the start.
